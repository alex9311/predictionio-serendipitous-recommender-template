# Serendipitous Recommender Template
Alex Simes

This is the recommender used in my Master's thesis project. It provides both baseline (collaborative) recommendations and serendipitous recommendations. Serendipitous recommendations are pre-calculated upon training, using the algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. in their [2012 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221519984_Auralist_Introducing_serendipity_into_music_recommendation).

Below is a short animation illustrating how the serendipitous algorithm works.
